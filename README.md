# smartender

I built a "smart bartender" using an Arduino nano, some wood and simple electrical componets.

## Usage

Right now the bartender is controlled by a wired remote, which is connected to the wooden box using an ethernet cable.
Inside the remote there is an 
[arduino nano clone](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Arduino-ATmega328P-Without-Compatible/dp/B0713XK923)
which allows me to control each pump and order cocktails.
